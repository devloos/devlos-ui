# Getting Started

Devlos UI is a collection of components based on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). However, we compile everything with a dui prefix so that it can be CSS framework-agnostic.

## Install devlos-ui

```bash
npm i devlos-ui@latest
```

## That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.
