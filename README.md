# Getting Started

Devlos UI is a collection of components based on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). We assume you are already familiar with the basic ideas of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) before you continue.

## Create project

Start by creating a new Vue project using `vite`:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

## Add Tailwindcss

Install `tailwindcss` and its peer dependencies, then generate your `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

## Configure Tailwindcss

Add this import header in your main css file, `src/index.css` in our case:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* ... */
```

Configure the tailwind template paths in `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

## Install devlos-ui

```bash
npm i devlos-ui@latest
```

## That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

# Usage

### Setup

Use the `import` statement to import any components needed.

```js
import { DragSelect } from "devlos-ui";
```

Simply use it as a component in any vue application.

```html
<DragSelect v-model="selectedItems" :items="items" class="...">
  <template #item="{ item }">
    <div class="...">
      <div>ID: {{ item.id }}</div>
    </div>
  </template>
</DragSelect>
```

### Demo

Drag within the container to select your items.

<script setup>
  import DragSelect from '../demos/DragSelect.vue'
</script>

<DragSelect />
